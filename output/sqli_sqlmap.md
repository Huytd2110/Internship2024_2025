[04:04:46] [CRITICAL] all tested parameters do not appear to be injectable. Try to increase values for '--level'/'--risk' options if you wish to perform more tests. If you suspect that there is some kind of protection mechanism involved (e.g. WAF) maybe you could try to use option '--tamper' (e.g. '--tamper=space2comment') and/or switch '--random-agent'

## Recommendations
- Use prepared statements (parameterized queries) for all database access.
- Enable a Web Application Firewall (e.g., ModSecurity + CRS) in production.
- Build a code review checklist for input validation and output encoding.
- Patch DVWA and all dependencies regularly.
- Integrate automated security testing (e.g., SonarQube, OWASP ZAP) into CI/CD.
- Regularly update payload signatures and review recent CVE advisories.
